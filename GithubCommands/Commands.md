# Git Cheet Sheet
## 1 - Install
    > Window        : http://windows.github.com
    > Mac           : http://mac.github.com
    > All platforms : http://git-scm.com
## 2 - Configure tooling 
    > git config --global user.name "[name]" : Sets the name you want attached to your commit transactions
    > git config --global user.email "[email address]" : Sets the email you want attached to your commit transactions
    > git config --global color.ui auto : Enables helpful colorization of command line output
## 3 - Branches
    >  git branch [branch-name] : Creates a new branch
    >  git checkout [branch-name]  : Switches to the specified branch and updates the working directory
    >  git merge [branch]  : Combines the specified branchâ€™s history into the current branch. This is usually done in pull requests, but is a  important Git operation
    > git branch -d [branch-name ] : Delete the Specific Branch
## 4 - Create repositories
    > git init : Turn an existing directory into a git repository
    > git clone [url] : Clone (download) a repository that already exists on GitHub, including all of the files, branches, and commits
## 5 - The .gitignore file
    > Sometimes it may be a good idea to exclude files from being tracked with Git. This is typically done in a special file named .gitignore. You can find helpful templates for .gitignore files at github.com/github/gitignore
## 6 - Synchronize changes
    > git fetch : Downloads all history from the remote tracking branches
    > git merge : Combines remote tracking branch into current local branch
    > git push  : Uploads all local branch commits to GitHub
    > git pull  : Updates your current local working branch with all new commits from the corresponding remote branch on GitHub. git pull is a combination of git fetch and git merge
